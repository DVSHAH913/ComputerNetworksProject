# Computer Networking Projects

Welcome to my Computer Networking projects portfolio. This repository showcases two projects I completed during my 2nd semester as part of my university projects. These projects provide a practical understanding of network architecture and computer network concepts.

- Enterprise Network Architecting
- Securing Interconnecting Systems

## Descriptions:

### Enterprise Network Architecting
I translated an online case study into a Cisco Packet Tracer project, where I designed and implemented a network solution for a trading floor support center accommodating 600 staff members. This involved creating a logical network design for a three-floor building with diverse departments. I integrated redundancy through a hierarchical model, connected to multiple ISPs, established wireless networks for each department, employed subnetting for IP allocation, and utilized OSPF as the routing protocol. The outcome was a future-proofed network meeting current and future needs.

### Securing Interconnecting Systems
In my second semester, I embarked on a Cisco Packet Tracer project focused on router security. Through OSPF implementation, I addressed secure access for laptops and PCs connecting to the router. With password-protected VTY lines and VTY line restrictions, I ensured user authentication and restricted unauthorized access, enhancing overall network security.
